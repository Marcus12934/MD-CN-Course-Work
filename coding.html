<h3>Necessary Methods, Skills And Resources</h3></div>
<div class="textdiv">
<p>To successfully complete IT projects there are many things that you will need,
    for example you will need a working internet connection. This is important because
    it allows you to keep in touch with other people that you are working with even when
    you are unable to meet in person, this means that work can still be effectively done
    even when meeting in person isnâ€™t possible. As well as this an internet connection
    gives you access to a vast amount of information which will help you to work even when
    you encounter problems, this will also help to improve the quality of your work as you
    will be able to learn about a subject while you are working. You will also need a computer
    as and an understanding of how to effectively use it as without this you will not be able
    to use it systems and programs to their full potential which will stop you from making
    your project the best that it can be and could stop you from completing it altogether.</p></div>

<h3>Planning When Using IT</h3></div>
<div class="textdiv">
<p>Planning a project is especially important and it can mean the difference between
    the project succeeding and failing. Because of this we were incredibly careful when
    planning our project making sure that we had all the details of the story completed
    before starting to code the game. We also made a trello board that details our work
    and our planning, this allowed us to complete the game very efficiently.
    This is our <a href=https://trello.com/invite/b/8exxua4c/2d75cde8c8171229b9d4b153c193c9a3/a-team-python-game>Trello Board</a>.</p></div>
