<h3>IT In Modern Business</h3></div>
<div class="textdiv">
<p>IT is used in modern businesses to improve efficiency. For example,
    IT systems can be used for filling in forms, weather that’s auto filling
    frequently used details like name, date of birth or an email address on a
    form, or the ability to fill in a form from the other side of the world,
    IT systems make it far more effective. They can also be used to make data
    more accessible for companies because instead of storing information in a
    book or in physical files it can be stored on a computer where it can quickly
    be accessed with a search engine. Furthermore, IT systems can help to keep
    employees connected, especially during the pandemic, by effectively using
    systems to help employees communicate online rather than face to face
    companies can keep running even when their offices are closed as people can
    work from home.

<h3>Risks To A project</h3></div>
<div class="textdiv">
<p>There are many potential reasons that a project could fail, for example it could
    fail due to lack of funding, which wouldn’t necessarily be the fault of the people
    running the project if they were underfunded but could be their fault if they went
    massively over budget. Another reason a project could fail is if the people running
    the project don’t have clear objectives set, this is because changing objectives
    frequently makes a project take far longer and puts it over budget. There are many
    potential risks to an IT project that you need to be aware of to help to ensure the
    safety of your project. A common risk to a project is human error, this can mean many
    different things, for example it can mean poor planning that ends up ruining a project
    as with inefficient planning people don’t know what they’re doing which means that they
    can’t complete tasks that are vital to the project that they are working on. Human
    error can also mean error in coding which stops systems from running. These can be
    hard to recognise, especially in large pieces of code, as some won’t show up as errors
    on your screen as they will technically be correct,
    but they won’t do what you want them to do.</p></div>
