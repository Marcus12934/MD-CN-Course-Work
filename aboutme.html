<h1 id="heading">About Me</h1>
<div class="textdiv">
<p>My name is Marcus Drury, and I am 20 years old. I have always loved
    technology and loved playing video games from a young age, because of
    this I have always been curious about how coding works and how games
    are made. This is why I was interested in learning python, as it would
    provide a way to gain a deeper understanding of how computers and games
    work, as well as this I also enjoy puzzles and problem solving. I also
    enjoy scuba diving as I find it fascinating being around all of the
    colourful underwater life.</p></div>
