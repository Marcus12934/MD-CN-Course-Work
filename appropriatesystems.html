<div class="textdiv">
<p>Selecting appropriate software to use is an appropriate part of any project.
    This means that you need to look at the software available to you and figure out
    what will be the most appropriate to use on the project. To do this you will need
    to decide exactly what your project requires and analyse the tools that are available
    to you. For example, if you needed to create a slideshow then you could decide to use
    Microsoft PowerPoint, however if you are in a group that’s working from home then you
    could use Google Slides as they update as you’re working so that everyone can see
    what’s been done.</p></div>
